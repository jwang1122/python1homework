How to use Postman

Open postman
Copy the link from app4.py and paste it in the space next to the send button
This is the link: http://localhost:5000/books
After you enter the link enter the id of one of your books in MongoDB
Next to the link there are options on what to do
Make sure you click the GET button before you send
It will show the book of the id you entered
In the box ubove the body make sure it is on raw, body, and JSON
Copy any of your books in MongDB and paste it in the box on top of the terminal
You can change whatever you want
For example you can change the author's name, the book title, the ratin etc.
After you do that, create your new book and it will show up in MongoDB
You can also delete your book by changing it from GET to DELETE
